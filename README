Ev6/Ev6wU

Ev6 is a prototype OS that aims to improve overall system reliability by increasing tolerance to ECC-uncorrectable errors in the OS kernel area.

Ev6's approach is to recover memory errors at the granularity of the memory object.

Ev6 recovers memory errors in the kernel area transparently from the user space, on the other hand, Ev6wU (Ev6 with User Cooperation) dares to eliminate transparency from the user space and enhances the recoverability by linking with the user space.
